## Tools
___

- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)

`nodemon` is a tool that helps in developing Node.js applications by automatically restarting Node applications when file changes in a directory are detected. This is especially useful during the development phase, as it saves you time from having to manually stop and restart the server every time you make changes to the code.

```
npm install nodemon --save-dev

```

- [ESLint] (https://eslint.org/)

`ESLint` is a linting tool for JavaScript. Linting is the process of checking your source code for potential problems, style errors, or violations of certain rules in writing code. By implementing linting, you can improve code quality, identify potential bugs, and make code easier to read and maintain.

```
npm install eslint --save-dev

```
> Configure before use

```
npx eslint --init

```
